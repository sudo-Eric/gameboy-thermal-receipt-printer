# Ggame Boy Thermal Receipt Printer

The goal of this project is to recreate the Game Boy printer using the [arduino-gameboy-printer-emulator](https://github.com/mofosyne/arduino-gameboy-printer-emulator?tab=readme-ov-file) project, a computer, and a modern thermal receipt printer.

This project uses Python and Cython. Dependencies are in [requirements.txt](requirements.txt). The setup file is optional and is only needed if you want to compile the project for better performance.

This project is in its early stages. While it is functional, there are still bugs and incomplete functionality.
